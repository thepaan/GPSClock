For the Micro sketch:

- Added the include for the Adafruit GFX library
- Added code for a second backpack
- Added code to correctly light the colon on the 1.2" display

- Disabled the chatty serial data that the Arduino was relaying from the GPS module




This is a modification of the sample libraries from Adafruit for the GPS and LED backpack modules.  I am not affiliated with Adafruit and have modified their stock libraries. Feel free to change as you wish- note their is a different code base for Arduino UNO and Arduino Micro. 

Enjoy!
